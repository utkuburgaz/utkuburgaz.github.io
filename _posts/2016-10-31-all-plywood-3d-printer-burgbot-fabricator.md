After designing a Prusa i3 upgrade with laser cut all plywood body parts, I wanted to design a Ultimater or MakerBot like printer. This one is called as BurgBot Fabricator :).  Just like the BurgBot Inventor it is designed by using SolidWorks 3D design software. 

Soon I will share details and BOM as a GitHub project for you to start building your own.

BurgBot features:

* Laser cut all plywood bodyparts, easy to set up with interlocking parts
* Panel mounted onboard LCD screen
* Onboard power source
* Onboard RAMPS controller board
* USB hub for data transport
* Direct drive extruder
* Heatbed with heat-resistant glass build plate
* Power socket and on/off button
* Robust body less vulnerable to vibrations and allows easy handling  
* Spool holder mounted at the back side
