In an effort to make a robust and easy to setup Prusa i3 version I designed this by using SolidWorks 3D design software.

BurgBot features:

* All plywood bodyparts, easy to set up with interlocking parts
* Panel mounted onboard LCD screen
* Onboard power source
* Onboard RAMPS controller board
* USB hub
* Direct drive extruder
* Heatbed with heat-resistant glass build plate
* Power socket and on/off button
* Robust body less vulnerable to vibrations and allows easy carrying  
* Spool holder mounted right at the top of the extruder
